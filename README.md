MovementSpeed Experiment 
User Speed Detection 
-The project aims to investigate whether software can detect the user's speed based on mouse cursor movement data.
-If proven successful, this concept could significantly contribute to advancing the HCI field, introducing speed as a valuable input for future software designs. 
-The software would be designed to perform actions in response to the detected user speed, opening new possibilities for user interaction.
